# Seminars

**Please Note**: We have an [online reading list](https://rl.talis.com/3/sta/lists/ACDDAD47-14D3-F1F6-0333-B8469BD83568.html) for the module for your convenience but it is harder to read, is sometimes missing texts, and does not include specific tasks that I set for your preparation. Always work from the handbook as you prepare your readings but you can check for ebook versions etc. with the digital reading list. Again: this **handbook is the canonical version** of your preparation guidelines, not the sometimes incorrect online reading list.

## Week 1 - Introduction to Buddhism

### Preparation

- We will try use only the first 30 minutes for introductions, and overview of the semester. During this time, we'll get everyone's name and I'll explain the main forms of assessment briefly.
- Please come having read or at least skimmed over the handbook sections on assessment. 
- Sign up for your two assessed presentation weeks, maximum of two people per week. (Teams)
- Consider reviewing the topics for each week and ask yourself what topics strike your interest. That is the first step in formulating a long essay topic, which should be something you work on every single week of the semester.
- Consider signing up for any elective reading categories you already know you are interested in (Teams)
- We will hit the ground running so please come having done the reading. 
- Elective reading is required, but you will not be penalized if you don't submit an elective handout this week. It would be nice if you did, however.

### Elective Reading

Each week you will be *required* to do additional reading but have a choice from a selection. You should provide an overview of this reading in the form of a supplementary handout (see above in handbook for instructions). We will try to maximise coverage of elective reading from week to week.  

Choose one of these categories: 
A1+A2 (Pure Land) OR B (Nichiren) OR C1+C2 (Ch’an/Zen) and read only the material labelled with your category.

## Week 2 - Introduction to Confucianism

### Preparation

- Please make sure you have already signed up for your presentation weeks (maximum two per week)
- I strongly advise you to begin reading around the areas of your potential interest to settle on a general area for your long essay. This is not an essay that one researches and writes in the week or two before the deadline but a semester long work. 
* Why not get one of your blog entries out of the way by posting something on one of the elective readings you did for last week or this week? Or one of the further readings?

### Required Reading

(~105)
  
These readings will give you some basic exposure to the Analects, Mengzi, and a little bit from Xunzi.

- Consider watching this [introductory video](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/who-was-confucius-bryan-w-van-norden) by Bryan W. Van Norden on Confucius.

## Week 6 - Independent Learning Week

- Use this week to make good progress on your long essay research and please begin the writing process, even if it is to draft some ideas. If you don't have a clear idea of your essay topic and a tentative argument, as well as the majority of your sources in hand, then this week is absolutely critical to make progress for a high quality essay.

If you changed topics over ILW, that is fine, and you are welcome to come with a new prospectus. Many of the best essays involved a first deep dive, and then a change of direction.

## Week 10 - Confucian Renewals

### Preparation

- As you continue work on your long essay, consider bringing an outline of the work so far to office hours and talking through your progress and challenges with me. 
- All students should have reached the writing point for their essay at this point to allow for revision of drafts of their work after identifying any weak areas in the argument and returning to evidence as needed.
- When you have completed a first draft of your long essay, read with a critical eye: is the argument clearly stated in the introduction. Have you answered the "so what?" question and established what original contribution your essay is making rather than merely summarising the existing state of the field? Do all the pieces of your essay work together to support the main argument or are there areas that lose focus or are not relevant? Do you have sub-arguments that need strengthening with further evidence? Do you need to tweak the argument or rebalance it?
