# Policies 

**Marking**

Within the School of History all work is assessed on a scale of 1-20 with intervals of 0.5. Module outcomes are reported using the same scale but with intervals of 0.1. The assessment criteria set out below are not comprehensive, but are intended to provide guidance in interpreting grades and improving the quality of assessed work. Students should bear in mind that presentation is an important element of assessment and that failure to adhere to the guidelines set out in the School of History Style Sheet will be penalised.

The marking scale can be found here:

**Undergraduate Student Handbook**

Many school policies and recommendations for undergraduate students may be found in the school handbook, which is available here:

**Extensions**

**Prior** permissions for late submission of work ("Extensions") to make fair allowance for adverse circumstances affecting a student's ability to submit the work on time will be considered on a case by case basis. Normally such permissions will only be granted for circumstances that are both unforeseen and beyond the student's control. Extensions of up to three days may be requested via the use of this School of History form and evaluated by the school administration:

[https://forms.office.com/e/F6zY0rL8Qt](https://forms.office.com/e/F6zY0rL8Qt)

Extensions of a longer period due to extraordinary circumstances will be evaluated by the module coordinator and may need approval from the Director of Teaching.

**Word Limits and Late Work**

It is important to work consistently through the semester and work around your other commitments and deadlines. Plan ahead and don't save your work until the last minute. Assessed work with word limits should be always submitted within those limits. Writing in a clear and concise manner, and being able to structure and execute an argument that may be shorter than you feel is required is a skill that is of great use in academic fields as well as the workplace beyond. Please do not go over the limit and force yourself to work within them as a practice that will be important for writing assignments in your future careers. 

The official School of Histories penalties for late work and short/long work are followed in this module:

**Please Note**: In this module you will not be penalised for a *long essay* that goes over the requested word range but is up to 5,000 words. This exception applies **only** to the long essay.  

**Absence from Classes**

Please see this page for more on our attendance policy:

[https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/students/ug/attendance/](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/students/ug/attendance/)

Note that three missed tutorials, regardless of self-certification or circumstances, will receive a "FINAL" academic alert and may result in a 0X fail mark unless an exception is approved by the Director of Teaching. The Director of Teaching must be contacted within seven days of receiving a final academic alert (histdot@st-andrews.ac.uk).


**Emails**

If you have a question that requires an answer with significant detail, please consider asking during office hours, or at the beginning or end of class. Please try to avoid sending emails that require more than a very brief answer. If the email requires a substantive answer, I may ask you to bring the question up again after our next class or in office hours. I will strive to offer a reply to emails received within 48 hours, whenever possible. Emails are usually not responded to over the weekend and may not even be read until Monday. In writing emails, please try to be clear about what you are asking, and keep in mind that your message is one among many from students of multiple classes and differing contexts. Please mention which course you are in and what specific matter you are referring to. As in class, feel free to address me by first name in emails. Finally, before hitting the send button, please confirm that the answer to your question is not found in the handbook, on official school websites, or other handouts provided to the class.

**Laptops in Class**

Recent studies are increasingly showing that, for whatever reasons, the handwriting of notes, and the reading of essays on physical paper as opposed to computers or other reading devices increases the quality of notes, significantly boosts recall, and better processing of content in general.

There are, however, many benefits to using a laptop for notes, and keeping reading content in digital form, not the least ready access, easy distribution, ability to re-sort notes, searchability, and for those who have handwriting as poor as mine: simple readability. 

You are welcome to bring a laptop to class and use it for notes and reading. Please do not to use applications on your laptop not related to our class, including email applications and social media. Obviously they will interfere with your own concentration but that is not the primary concern: using other applications on your laptop is a severe distraction to anyone sitting next to you.

There will a number of occasions during the seminar when full undivided attention is required by students. Group work not related to sources, student presentations, and some other moments will not require any note-taking or referring to documents on your computer. In those occasions I may ask students to close laptops or turn over tablets so they can concentrate on the task at hand.

**Academic Misconduct and Plagiarism**

Academic integrity is fundamental to the values promoted by the University. It is important that all students are judged on their ability, and that no student is allowed unfairly to take an advantage over others, to affect the security and integrity of the assessment process, or to diminish the reliability and quality of a St Andrews degree. For more information on university policies see:

[https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/education/staff/assessment/good-academic-practice/](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/education/staff/assessment/good-academic-practice/)

**Large Language Models**

Students are permitted to use Large Language Models (LLMs, or generative AI) in this module, as they see fit, but it is imperative that they understand the limitations of the technology. If you decide to use them (to assist in research, editing your writing, etc.), you, as the student, are fully responsible for your submissions. Fake or hallucinated citations or other content will be significantly penalised in your mark as an expression of poor research skills. I have a separate document where I outline the ways in which LLMs (generative AI) *may* be potentially useful in the course of your research and writing. Summative assessments should include a declaration of what LLM models where used and a brief description of how they were used.

If you are unsure about the correct presentation of academic material, you should approach your tutor. You can also contact CEED, which provides an extensive range of training on Academic Skills.
