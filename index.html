<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This intellectual history of late modern East Asia explores the ways
social, political and religious movements, as well as the evolving ideas
of key individuals in Korea, Japan, and China hoped to transform or
reimagine the social and political order of their times Literary and
visual sources as well as philosophical or religious texts, debates, and
the political tracts of various movements will be at the core of the
module and offer opportunities to explore the multiplicity of
inspirations and dynamic nature of the intellectual history of the
region that challenges some common depictions of the relationship
between tradition and modernity, as well as assumptions about the
simplistic adaptation of Western ideologies in East Asian history.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="assignments">Assignments</h1>
<p>The <strong>summative</strong> assessed portion of the coursework for
this module consists of <strong>one long essay</strong>, a <strong>long
essay prospectus</strong>, one <strong>ten minute presentation</strong>,
and four <strong>reading analysis posts</strong>. There are several
<strong>formative</strong> assessments. These include a
<strong>formative presentation</strong> (optional), a draft prospectus
(optional), essay outline, and five elective reading handouts.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Paper submissions are not requested for any of
the assessments. You may upload the submissions directly onto MMS.
Formative assessments are often shared on Teams for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="headers-and-formatting">Headers and Formatting</h3>
<p>At the top of all your written work or on a cover page, you are
required to include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date: The date of submission</li>
<li>Assignment: The assignment you are submitting (e.g. Long Essay,
etc.)</li>
<li>Student Number</li>
<li>Title: A <em>specific title</em> for your essay in the case of the
Long Essay</li>
<li>Word Count: The total number of words (use the word count feature of
your word processor, including footnotes)</li>
</ul>
<p>When formatting your assignments, you are required to follow these
guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add page numbers!</li>
<li>Use a minimum of 12 sized font</li>
</ul>
<p>Other aspects of formatting are highlighted in the School of History
style sheet. See the following section.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-and-bibliography">Footnotes and Bibliography</h3>
<p>Long essays must use footnotes and a bibliography. Reading analysis
posts can use simple parenthetical citation with no bibliogrpahy. Please
carefully read the St Andrews School of History Style Sheet:</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/assets/university/schools/school-of-history/documents/current-students/school-of-history-style-guidelines.docx">School
of History Style Sheet</a></p>
<p>This document, sections 1-4, contains extremely valuable information
on how to compose your essay, including how to format your footnotes and
bibliography. In particular, please follow the instructions for
footnotes carefully. Note: reading analysis posts do not need a
bibliography (see below).</p>
<p>In your bibliography, please have separate sections for your
secondary sources and the primary sources you used.</p>
<p>If you prefer <strong>and do so consistently</strong>, you may use
the Chicago Style (Notes and Bibliography) over the St Andrews note
formatting. I encourage you to manage your sources in a referencing tool
such as <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> to help manage your
sources.</p>
<h2 id="presentation">Ten Minute Presentation</h2>
<p><strong>15% Presentation Recorded with Slides or In-person with
Handout</strong></p>
<p>Being able to synthesise reading and present ideas orally in class is
a key skill and you will have opportunities to improve this skill during
the semester in four ways: 1) You will be formally assessed on
<strong>one presentation</strong>. 2) If you are presenting in Week
3-11, you may submit a recorded formative presentation to get some early
feedback on your presentation skills in an office hour meeting. 3) In
addition, in any given week, if asked, you should be prepared to speak
to the class for 2-3 minutes about the elective reading you have signed
up for that week. You should be able to introduce the reading to other
students who may not have read the reading, and articulate its main
contributions to the week’s themes in a concise manner. If you are
uncomfortable with being called on in this way about elective readings,
please get in touch so we can discuss other options. 4) You will often
be asked to discuss readings and questions in groups.</p>
<p>Sign-ups for in-person presentations are in Week 1 and are limited in
numbers. Other presentations are recorded. In-person presentations
require a handout but should not have slides. Recorded presentations
have slides, but no handout. Slides or handout should be submitted to
MMS by the day before your presentation as well as shared on Teams for
everyone. Recorded presentations must be uploaded to the team at least
48 hour before our class begins so everyone has a chance to watch it.
See the content session below for information about what to present
on.</p>
<p><strong>Recorded Presentation</strong></p>
<p>The recorded presentation has slides but no handout. Record your
voice over slides in Apple Keynote, in Powerpoint, or some other
application, <strong>but this must export the result as a movie
file</strong> for sharing with your teammates - you may not submit a
powerpoint or keynote file and it should be a standalone video file that
you share with the class via Teams (you can upload the simple slides or
exported PDF of slides to MMS). You must submit the video <em>at least
48 hours before the class</em> related to the content, or you will
receive a late penalty for each day as if it were an essay submitted
late. A strong first class recorded presentation will not have very text
heavy slides, will have an excellent connection between visual, textual,
content and linking of slide content and spoken word, and will be
delivered in a dynamic manner.</p>
<ul>
<li>IMPORTANT: You must submit a movie to teams for sharing with the
class - <em>not a powerpoint file with embedded sound, and not a keynote
file</em>, but a movie file. Again: you must submit a movie file (MP4,
etc.). The MMS upload can be a pdf or slides file.</li>
<li>Confirm that your movie can be viewed using the open source software
<a href="https://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a>.</li>
<li>After saving as a movie file, please confirm that voice is clearly
audible (not a faint or unclear voice) and your slides display.</li>
<li>The recorded presentation video should be uploaded to the class
files in Microsoft Teams no later than 48 hours before the class
relevant to the content which lists the book as an option. No handout
for the recorded presentation.</li>
<li>Please name the video file you upload strictly following this
format: the week number, your first name, “Presentation”, and a title of
the text your presentation is about. For example: “W5 - Sarah
Presentation - The Book Title”</li>
<li>Consider making good use of visual images, and try to keep the
amount of text on screen, except for cases of an important quote, to a
minimum.</li>
<li>Recorded presentations assess a slightly different set of skills
than the in person presentation: they are a good way to practice and
improve your ability combine images with your voiced narration and a
small amount of text on screen. More time is required to prepare a
recorded presentation, but you have the advantage of being able to
re-record sections you are unhappy with. More time is required to find
effective visual material and evaluate the amount of textual material
you will present to supplement your voice, but you don’t need to worry
about either the handout or responding to questions.</li>
<li>if a recorded presentation with slides, make effective use of
images, show restraint in the use of text, generally slides that are
merely a list of bullet points (in other words, don’t do what lecturers
often do at St Andrews!).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In-Person Presentation</strong></p>
<p>We will have a limited number of slots during the semester for
in-person presentations, first come, first serve via sign-up list on
week 1. You are expected to produce a supplementary handout (single side
of a single page) and answer one or two questions directed at you after
your presentation. A strong first class live dissertation will not be
read from an exact transcript, nor will it reproduce exactly content
from any handout bullet points: it will be well-practiced.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the handout to indicate the overall structure of your
presentation and key points you will make. You may include some basic
names, events, or places of importance, or any key quotes.</li>
<li>The handout should be shared via the Team by the beginning of class
to the appropriate folder and be named strictly as follows: the week
number, your first name, and a title of the text your presentation is
about. For example: “W5 - Sarah - The Book Title”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Presentation Content</strong></p>
<p>Unless you secure permission for a special topic from me, the topic
of your presentation should be a <em>single author</em> monograph (not
an edited volume of different chapters) from among those approved for
the given week of your presentation. Throughout the seminar readings
provided below you will see a (P) next to appropriate texts you may
present on (don’t forget to check the further reading for options). If
the work is in the required or elective reading section, however,
<strong>your presentation should cover the entirety of the
work</strong>, not merely any assigned chapters.</p>
<p>Because you are presenting on the work <em>as a whole</em> the
presentation assessment, it is impossible to cover everything. You can
tell us what aspects of the book you will focus on and which ones you
will say little or nothing about based on their importance overall. You
must have read to book as a whole, however, to know what is important or
not important to present. This presentation will evaluate your
demonstration of your ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>choose what is most useful to share: author background, key
arguments in the work, cases it considers, strengths and weaknesses,
links to other reading of the week when relevant</li>
<li>include illustrative examples that give the listener a feel for the
work</li>
<li>project your voice clearly, make use of effective pauses, modulate
your voice effectively</li>
<li>make use of a spoken rather than a written register that engages the
listener</li>
<li>avoid exactly reproducing the content of a handout and don’t sound
like you are using bullet points</li>
</ul>
<p>The assessed presentation should be 10 minutes in length <em>and not
a minute longer</em>. Being slightly under the time limit is fine. The
presentation should summarise the main arguments, point out what was
most interesting or useful as a takeaway from the chosen text, and
include at least some consideration of your critical evaluation: discuss
at least one limitation or shortcoming. This should be substantive,
based on an evaluation of concrete content, not superficial or based on
your own enjoyement of the text (avoid “it was too long”, “it was
boring”, “it was too theoretical”, etc.). It should <em>not</em> a
detailed and exhaustive retelling of the content: it should set the
context, highlight the arguments, strengths, contributions, and offer an
evaluation. Nor is your goal to determine whether or not you can
“recommend” that someone should read a book. Part (but not all) of the
presentation may offer greater detail on a particularly important
section.</p>
<p><strong>What Ifs</strong></p>
<p>If you have signed up for an in person presentation and you are sick
or otherwise unable to attend your presentation, contact Konrad. Make-up
presentations will be in the form of a recorded presentation. If you
submit a recorded presentation late (that is, later than 48 hours before
class to both MMS and Teams), you will receive the standard -1 per day
it is late until it is submitted.</p>
<p><em>Some questions I consider when marking the
presentations:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Did the student project their voice clearly, modulate their voice
appropriately, make effective use of pauses</li>
<li>Did the student speak at an appropriate pace and not overload their
presentation with too much content?</li>
<li>Did the student appear to move beyond simply reading a written
document?</li>
<li>Did the distributed handout accurately summarize the general points
to be made in the presentation in the form of concise bullet
points?</li>
<li>Did the handout include any important dates, sources, key people,
or, if necessary, a map that serves as a useful reference?</li>
<li>Was the time minute limit very strictly observed in the
presentation?</li>
<li>Did the presentation provide the context of the work, and very
briefly introduce the author without this taking up too much time?</li>
<li>Was the presentation well-structured, organized, and focus on a only
a few key points in depth?</li>
<li>Was there a good balance of arguments, examples to support them, and
critique?</li>
<li>Did the presentation avoid being a presentation of a series of
bullet-point style facts?</li>
<li>Did the presentation make an effort to connect the readings to other
readings for the day or find ways to connect to the reading and
discussion from previous weeks?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="formativepres">Formative Presentation</h4>
<p>Presentations can be a stressful assessment for some students and
practice helps. Any student who has signed up for a presentation from
Week 3-11 may submit a recording of a 3 minute presentation focused on
one of our required or elective readings (just an article or a chapter
is fine from within the assigned material of any kind) and book an
office hour to get feedback on this presentation and suggestions for
their assessed presentation. Keep in mind you will need to share this on
the team in the folder labeled as such at least a full day before office
hours to leave time for your tutor to watch it and be able to give
feedback.</p>
<h2 id="posts">Reading Analysis Blog Posts</h2>
<p>We have a module blog at:</p>
<p><a
href="http://transnationalhistory.net/world/">http://transnationalhistory.net/world/</a></p>
<p><strong>20% At least four posts posted online in four weeks and then
Final MMS Upload of four Chosen Posts Friday, Week 11, 5pm</strong></p>
<p>This is a public facing website where students will contribute
postings, but no students will be asked to use their real name. The
posts there should be for an external audience who is interested in
learning more about the topic and not be written from the perspective of
a student in a class. It should include footnotes for reference to a
source, but should not include a bibliography. You can set or change
your pseudonym through the blog interface whenever you like. Students
are required to post a <strong>minimum of four postings</strong> during
the semester and these postings must be <strong>posted across at least
four different weeks</strong>.</p>
<p>Again, your blog entries must be <strong>written, uploaded, and
publicly visible</strong> on dates from four different weeks (Monday to
Sunday semester weeks). You cannot write the posts and then upload them
all at once as the deadline nears. You cannot post entries and set their
date to an earlier point in the semester. Any submitted blog entry which
comes from the same Monday to Sunday week as another post will receive a
4 point penalty.</p>
<p>You will receive a mark for these only after final submission of all
posts, but you are welcome to come to office hours to ask for oral
feedback on your first or second post. I strongly urge you to get most
or all of these out of the way quickly, ideally by Week 6 or Week 7 so
you can focus your energies on essay research and writing.</p>
<p><strong>Blog Posts - What to Write:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You should focus <strong>either on a primary source or an elective
reading</strong> or put readings in conversation with eachother. If you
choose a primary source, consider analysing a primary source that is
referred to in one of our required or elective or further secondary
readings rather than our required assigned primary sources, or find a
new primary historical source of relevance which connects to the topic
of the week. Look at some of the earlier blog posts for inspiration.
Introduce the source to a blog visitor who is not in our class and may
not be very knowledgeable about East Asia then make an argument with it.
Don’t refer to our class, but write the post for the blog’s external
audience.</li>
<li>If you are also submitting a handout on a week you post a blog entry
(which you are free to do), you should not have the handout and the post
be on the same text.</li>
<li>I recommend that your post make a single clear argument about a
reading/s, backed with evidence and several examples from one or ideally
several of the texts</li>
<li>Posts that put the week’s readings in conversation with each other
or connect to previous weeks are most welcome, but to the end of a
single overarching point.</li>
<li>Please make at least one explicit reference to a source, but ideally
your post will have several. This should be footnoted using Wordpress
format footnote. (( after the sentence period, put your footnote inside
double parentheses like this. ))<br />
</li>
<li>Your posts should ideally each aim to be between 500-700 words each
(remember all of them together should add up to 2,500)</li>
<li>The posts should have a single overarching purpose and unified focus
- if you find your post getting too long ask yourself if you have
remained focused throughout.</li>
<li>Avoid vague references to what you like and don’t like; what you
found interesting or not interesting - again: use these posts as a place
to practice the making and supporting of arguments about your
reading.</li>
<li>Be concise and avoid repetition.</li>
<li>LLMs (generative AI) are strictly forbidden for use in these posts
and, at any rate, are unlikely to write satisfactory posts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Many, perhaps most, of you will only write
four posts during the semester. However, you are free to write more
posts for the blog but you may <strong>only submit four of them in Week
11 on MMS</strong>. You may make minor editorial changes (corrections to
language etc.) on the MMS submitted version, but may not make them
longer. You may make them shorter by cutting material, if you like.</p>
<p><strong>How to Post Blog Entries:</strong> You will be given details
for your login information late in the first week. Then to login, go
to:</p>
<p><a
href="http://transnationalhistory.net/world/post/">http://transnationalhistory.net/world/post/</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not copy and paste from Microsoft Word or use Word
footnotes</strong> - this creates formatting issues on WordPress. You
can compose it in a raw text editor (e.g. VS Code or any plain text
editor or markdown editor) and copy and paste from there, but not from
Word or word processors that don’t use raw text. Alternatively you may
compose and save the entries directly on WordPress.</li>
<li>Use your login user name and password. You will receive this by the
end of Week 1.</li>
<li>From there, on the left hand sidey ou can choose “Add New” from the
“Posts” menu.</li>
<li>There, give your posting a title</li>
<li>add a few tags on the right side without any caps, for example
“japan, 20th century, kyoto school, philosophy of time, nishitani” that
indicate things like place, time, people, topics that are relevant to
your posting (all without caps).</li>
<li>Write your blog posting in the middle</li>
<li>When you have a quote or refer to a text, you must add a footnote by
enclosing the footnote countents in double parenthesis. You must leave a
space before the first and after the last parenthesis. Example: Here is
some text. ((And here is the footnote contents with a space before
it))</li>
<li>Don’t worry about adding categories.</li>
<li>You can “preview” your posting if you want to read it over and look
for mistakes with a nicer view.</li>
<li>you can save your draft as you write.</li>
<li>When you are happy with the posting, click “Publish” or save the
draft if you wish to return to it later</li>
<li>You can always return to postings by going to “Posts” on the left
and “All Posts”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="handouts">Elective Reading Handouts</h2>
<p><strong>Five Handouts Shared on Teams Channel by Evening Before
Relevant Class</strong></p>
<p>During the semester, you are required to submit at least
<strong>three elective reading handouts</strong>. You may submit no more
than one handout per week but you may choose the weeks. I strongly
encourage you to get this done early in the semester. These are not
marked, but submission of three of them is required to pass the module.
Each week on Teams, <strong>by the evening before class at
11pm</strong>, you can upload a reading handout as a pdf odt, rtf, docx,
or txt file to the “Files” for the channel of the week. The handout
should be <strong>two pages</strong> and provide general info about the
elective reading you chose. At the top, write 2-4 sentences which
summarizes the text/s in your own words (you may not use generative AI
for this!), including any main argument of the work/s. On the rest of
the two page should include information you think is most important on
the structure of the text/s, timeline, main sources used, key
historiography engaged with, people or description of events discussed,
and your own main takeaway points. You may make use of bullet points,
lists, outlines, etc. Please name your handout strictly following this
format: the week number, your first name, “Handout”, the category of
elective reading and category title. For example: “W5 - Henrik Handout -
C [name of elective reading category]”</p>
<ul>
<li>These are required submissions but not marked.</li>
<li>The whole thing may be in the form of hierarchical bullet points if
you like, but make most of these full sentences whenever possible,
rather than fragmented phrases except when outlining structure or
listing things.</li>
<li>No smaller than size 10 font. No need for images</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prospectus">Prospectus and Indicative Bibliography</h2>
<p><strong>15% abstract, overview, and bibliography of a minimum of 12
secondary sources for your long essay due Friday Week 7 5pm</strong></p>
<p>15% of your mark for the module comes from a 500 word prospectus, a
proposal or abstract for your long essay, including a draft articulation
of a possible argument and an indicative bibliography (the latter not
included in word count). You are also strongly encouraged to come to
office hours to discuss a draft of this you will have an opportunity to
submit earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Prospectus</strong> (500 Words): Write a brief summary of
your essay <strong>as if you have already written it</strong>. What did
it do (in the past tense)? What kinds of sources did you use? How did
you structure the essay? Include in this 500 words a sentence in
<strong>bold</strong> which is a statement of the essay’s proposed
argument. At this early stage of your research, this is highly
speculative, and it is very unlikely to end up being the actual argument
you will make in your essay. Your eventual final argument will also
likely be much more concrete than it is here in the prospectus but use
this as an opportunity to practice stating a possible argument you will
make.</p>
<p><strong>Indicative Bibliography</strong>: Divided into two sections,
primary and secondary sources, offer a list of sources that you will
have access to in a language you can read that you think will be useful
for your essay based on your reading so far. For each source, include
one complete sentence explaining why you think the source is useful.
List no fewer than 12 secondary sources and no more than 30 (for this
exercise). Sources should not merely be limited to those directly on the
topic, but “climb up the ladder of abstraction” to include important
works on the more general topic you can learn from.</p>
<p>If you shared a draft prospectus earlier, include a copy of the first
draft prospectus after your submission (obviously, this doesn’t count
against your word count). You will be <strong>primarily</strong> be
evaluated on whether your argument clear, your scope realistic, your
structure logical, and if you included an earlier draft, how you have
developed your ideas in response to your first prospectus (if you have
changed topics, which is not at all uncommon, you should still work on
improving the quality of the proposal). You will be only
<strong>secondarily</strong> marked on the overall historical merit of
your proposal, whether the sources appropriate for the task, and whether
the structure and scope indicated by your prospectus are well
crafted.</p>
<h4 id="formative">Draft Prospectus</h4>
<p>You will have an opportunity (optional) to share a draft of your
prospectus on Teams for our Week 4 meeting. We will meet in groups to
get peer feedback and you may get oral feedback from me in office hours.
I may also offer some suggestions in replies to the posts on Teams or in
class.</p>
<h2 id="longessay">Long Essay</h2>
<p>The 4,000 word essay (including footnotes) for the course is worth
50% of the total coursework. It may be up to 5,000 words without penalty
(as opposed to the penalty starting at 10% limit over 4,400). Penalties
for longer essays are then are as normal. 5,001 words receives a -1
penalty, and 5,401 a -2 penalty, 5,801 a -3 penalty and so on.</p>
<p>This is not an essay you research and compose in the final weeks of
the semester. This essay requires you to make progress on it throughout
the semester. Again: <strong>You must set aside several hours every week
to work on this essay</strong>. Narrow down an area of interest, read
within this area of interest, isolate a few themes of interest, carry
out further reading and analysis, and then proceed to write an essay
which makes a convincing historical argument.</p>
<p>Some class time in most weeks will be dedicated to discussing the
essay. It is not uncommon for a student to change topics once or twice
during the semester, as the feasibility of one topic or another is
evaluated and the sources explored. I don’t recommend bigger topic
changes after Week 7. My suggestion is that you answer two questions for
yourself very early in your research: 1) Once you have a general topic
or area of history you are interested in, think about what kinds of
arguments or historical approaches have been applied to this area before
that will serve as the starting point for your intervention? 2) What
kinds of primary sources do you have realistic access to for use in the
essay. Most first class essays will show an ability to carry out
original research that includes use and analysis of <strong>primary
sources</strong>, but students may choose to do a historiographical
essay instead. It is harder, but by no means impossible, to meet the
first class grade descriptors for a historiographical essay.</p>
<h3 id="eras">Topics for the Essay</h3>
<p>Your essay should be an argument driven analytic research essay. You
may write your essay on <em>any topic related to the intellectual
history of East Asia or Southeast Asia</em> (not limited to the time
period we primarily focus on). This may include history of religion,
history of philosophy, and the history of social and political thought.
Check with me first, but I will also be generally open to approving
topics on almost any element of the cultural history of the region as
well.</p>
<p><em>Journals for Inspiration:</em> I would suggest browing some of
the following journals, and especially note articles that fit the above
description:</p>
<p><em>The Journal of Asian Studies</em><br />
<em>Monumenta Nipponica</em><br />

<h3 id="making-an-argument">Making an Argument</h3>
<p>The academic study of history embraces change in the past as a way to
explore solutions to particular problems. The object of an analytical
historical research essay is not to tell us simply what happened, but to
use what happened in order to make a historical argument about some
problem clearly defined. For example, if an essay was written (to take
an example from Chinese history) about some aspect of the religious
aspects of the Boxer Rebellion, it should not consider its task complete
when the major facts of the Boxer Rebellion and its religious elements
have been retold. That is closer to the genre of the encyclopaedia entry
than of academic historical study. It should endeavour to use the Boxer
Rebellion as an opportunity to make an argument about something: what
does the rebellion reveal about the nature of Western imperialism? The
rise of new religious movements in China? The weakness of the late Qing
state? The rise of Japan? The answer takes the form of a claim that does
more than merely repeat a synthesis of what previous scholarship has
established and agrees to be the case. The possibilities are many, but
in every case, they offer an answer to the question: So what? History
can and should tell stories, but a research essay embeds a story within
an arc of an argument - if it contains narrative elements, it must also
always include an analytic element.</p>
<p>The historical argument in your long essays, in particular, should be
clearly and unambiguously stated in the span of 1-3 sentences somewhere
in the opening third of the essay, preferably in the opening paragraph
or two. It should not be obvious, trivial, or a well-known and rarely
contested fact. Challenging as false an existing historian’s argument
that has become considered obvious and rarely contested, however, is one
ambitious way to find your way to an interesting and original argument
but only if your evidence is sufficient. Alternatively, if you have
found evidence that supports the existing arguments of historians in a
given area of research in a new set of sources, from a fresh
perspective, or in greater depth, or in a comparative light, that also
often yields a strong argument. If you have identified a debate in the
historiography and wish to take a position on it without simply
repeating all of the points made by one of the participants of the
debate, that can also yield an essay with a strong argument but you
should take care to acknowledge the position and evidence of the other
side.</p>
<p><strong>Presenting your Argument:</strong> There are a number of
different ways to write a strong essay and present the argument, but in
this module, I would like to strongly encourage you to “front-load” your
argument and do so clearly, that is, to present clearly early in the
essay what it is you will argue and why it is important. For example,
avoid sentences such as “I will explain…” or “I aim to understand…” or
“I will explore…” unless such sentences are immediately followed by the
explanation, what you ended up understanding, or what the result of your
exploration was. Otherwise, there is a danger that your essay will
merely provide a summary of some quantity of information you have found,
rather than present the results of your analysis of that research in a
useful way. In other words, do not use the introduction to make
predictions about what you will do, but tell the reader in very clear
terms what you <strong>have argued and shown</strong> in the essay.
There are many ways to do this in more or less subtle language but there
is no harm in a very clear, <strong>“In this essay, I will argue
that…”</strong> followed by the rest of your argument, a short overview
of what kinds of evidence you will use, how your argument fits into a
historiographical context (how your argument relates to what other
historians have to say about the matter), and why you think it is
important.</p>
<p><strong>Sticking to your Argument:</strong> All of us come across
many interesting stories, anecdotes, and sub-points that we want to
share in writing our essays. However, it is important to <strong>stay
sharply focused on the main argument</strong> you are going to make in
the essay. After you have finished writing your essay, read it through
and for each paragraph and sentence ask yourself if it supported your
argument, provided essential background to establishing your argument,
or else if it does not offer much of a contribution. If it doesn’t, cut
it ruthlessly from your essay to make room for better material.</p>
<p>Engaging with the historiography: What does this phrase mean? It
means directly and explicitly acknowledging what historians have said
about your topic and your specific question in existing work. Point out
both positive contributions and problematic ones when appropriate. Who
has worked on this before, and what specifically have they argued? See
your essay as part of a larger conversation (it doesn’t necessarily have
to be an adversarial one) that includes previous historians. Once you
have considered those who have done research very close to your case or
argument, also engage with the important historiography in the broader
field most relevant to your topic.</p>
<p>Some other questions to ask yourself as you write the long essay:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the essay have a clear introduction which articulates the
argument I wish to make in the essay? Does it move beyond telling the
reader what the essay is “about” and what the essay “will do” to tell
the reader very clearly what <em>has been accomplished</em> in the essay
and <em>what be specifically shown</em> in the essay, and not leave this
only for the conclusion?</li>
<li>Does the essay have a clear conclusion which restates the main
points and then makes some effort to contextualise the findings in the
broader issues of the course?</li>
<li>Does the essay situate the argument being made in the context of the
sources used, and its relevance to the study of our module topic?</li>
<li>Does the essay show a good understanding of the sources used, and
use them effectively in supporting my argument with clear and specific
examples to enforce my points?</li>
<li>Does the essay avoid long quotations from secondary works whenever
possible? Do I instead summarise, without plagiarising, and cite the
work of secondary work except when the particular wording or language is
key to the argument I wish to make?</li>
<li>Have I cited with footnotes all claims that are not a well-known and
general historical fact.</li>
<li>Have I used a variety of appropriate sources to provide evidence in
support of my claims?</li>
<li>Have I avoided using phrases like “many historians argue” or “much
scholarship” or “it is often argued” and offer specific examples and
citations?</li>
<li>Does the essay retain a strong focus on the main argument, and avoid
passages which stray significantly from the main points?</li>
<li>Does the essay avoid being a summary or introduction to a particular
topic, event, or person in order to make a clear argument that is
falsifiable?</li>
<li>Have I gone back and considered my major claims from a critical
perspective, and answered any major possible weaknesses in my
essay?</li>
<li>Is my argument non-trivial? That is, does it go beyond a well-known
historical consensus about a topic?</li>
<li>Has the long essay engaged with the historiography on the relevant
issue effectively throughout?</li>
<li>Does the essay consider alternative explanations, acknowledge
inconvenient facts, and point out sources or historians who may have
differing approaches?</li>
<li>Did I proofread my essay, check the spelling, and reread for
sentences that are unclear? Did I avoid using imprecise or abstract
terms when concrete ones would suit better?</li>
<li>Did I carefully follow the style guide for the School of History for
all my footnotes?</li>
<li>Did I include a bibliography at the end of my essay and is it
formatted according to the School of History style guide? Does it have
separate sections for primary and secondary sources?</li>
<li>Have I avoided using websites and newspaper articles not by academic
authors to support my claims when there are good academic historical
scholarship (in monograph, journal article, or online published
forms)</li>
<li>Have I taken care that the introduction, historiography and any
background does not take up too much of the entire length of the essay
(less than 25%, usually)</li>
<li>Did I include a word count in the header and followed the other
header guidelines?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="carrying-out-research-for-essays">Carrying Out Research for
Essays</h3>
<p><strong>Secondary to Primary</strong>: When you have selected a
question or broader topic for your longer essay the first, one common
approach is to look for information on the topic among the various books
and articles that are assigned or proposed in this course, especially
the further reading of each week. This is the “secondary to primary”
approach. Early on, it is useful to focus on skimming through sources as
you find them, noting carefully works of potential interest found in the
footnotes or bibliographies of these works to help you broaden and then
later focus in your research. “Scrape” the bibliography and footnotes of
more general works in your area of interest, look those works up and
then “scrape” the bibliography/footnotes of those works (move between
recent books/articles and older ones to try to fill out your search
better). Eventually you will get a broader shape of the landscape of
research around your topic. Along the way you will get the feel for what
the key works are, but also what more general works “up the ladder of
abstraction” are often cited that influence the writers or help them
establish basic categories and concepts. You hopefully also get an
impression for what kinds of primary sources have been used in the past,
or at least categories of sources that may be useful. Then dive into the
primary sources, either those which you have found through the secondary
scholarship, or which may have been neglected by it but which has
potentially something to contribute.</p>
<p><strong>Primary then Secondary</strong>: Other students and scholars
argue that you should avoid reading closely related secondary research
on a topic in the first stage (beyond very general background), but
instead directly dive into a set of relevant primary sources. Reading
these, they look for things that stand out or which surprise or shock
them, then they return to the secondary scholarship. If your initial
ideas and reading end up not working out and you need to pivot during
the semester, this is often a great way to do it: instead of starting
the process above from scratch, find a rich body of primary sources and
dive deep with them. Even with time lost on one idea, some of the best
essays I have read have emerged from a student who has read deeply on
some initial topic, started over, and this time tried things the other
way around, starting with a single collection of interesting historical
primary sources.</p>
<p>Whichever of these general approaches you take, in reality all
students and scholars will need to move back and forth multiple times
between primary and secondary sources as they refine their research
questions and their proposed arguments.</p>
<p>When you do not find enough through the above method of beginning
your trail with our existing assigned works and module handbook
bibliography, proceed to search in various databases for relevant
keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>The secondary bibliography at the end of this handbook</li>
<li>The primary sources at the end of this handbook</li>
<li>Our library catalogue</li>
<li>Major journal databases we have access to such as JSTOR and
MUSE</li>
<li>Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) which can then direct you to
other journals our library may provide access to</li>
<li>Google Books and The Internet Archive (archive.org)</li>
<li>Consult with librarians - they are your friend. Bring them what you
have found already and work with them to find further resources.</li>
<li>LLMs - Large Language Models such as ChatGPT are highly problematic
tools given their propensity to confidently manufacture completely false
information, but may be useful as <em>one early part</em> of your
brainstorming process. See my separate document on the LLM policy for
this module.</li>

<p>The long essays should use at least a dozen secondary sources which
are not websites and the inclusion of several primary sources (their
number depends very much on what you are doing with them) is strongly
encouraged. An essay based on sources that are the results of a simple
google search can be written in an evening of frantic last minute work,
but rarely demonstrates much effort, research skill, or ability to
isolate high-quality materials to support an argument. This is not
because there are not excellent websites with overviews on a topic,
excellent wikipedia entries, etc. but because there is still usually far
greater quality material found in published articles and books on most
historical topics, including those which are assigned above. It is wise
to make use of online research skills to get oriented in a new topic,
but use this course as an opportunity to explore the wealth of academic
research on your topics. Your essays will be assessed, in part, on how
effectively your sources demonstrate your research efforts. Of course,
digitized primary (archival sources, documents) or secondary sources
(e.g. articles in academic databases) found in digital collection are
permitted and an online source or two in addition to your other sources
beyond the minimum is fine if chosen carefully for quality.</p>
<p>The process described above of “scraping” footnotes and
bibliographies is a stage which requires only rapid skimming and brisk
movement across a large number of candidate materials. This might be
combined with a closer reading of a good general work. Once you have a
good body of secondary sources, you can return to works previously
skimmed and read in a more informed targeted way. In researching for an
essay you rarely have to read an entire work, and even when you do so,
you should skim less relevant sections. Unlike reading for pleasure,
historical research involves reading as a hunt for answers to problems.
If you find that your argument does not hold or has insufficient
evidence to support it, zoom out again and restart the process. This
circular movement is one very effective approach to historical research.
Start broad, find potential key arguments and inspiring ideas. Moving
quickly, test these ideas and arguments by searching in other sources
and zooming into detailed cases and examples. If this doesn’t work or is
insufficient, zoom out again and repeat. Once you are happy with an
argument and the available evidence, then read more slowly and with
determination, taking more detailed notes, and outlining your essay as
you go.</p>
<p><strong>The Worst Possible Way to Proceed:</strong> Perhaps the worst
possible way to do research for your essay is to find a dozen or two
works on your broad topic by title search. This usually results in you
finding several very general and introductory works on your topic. Allow
this collection of books and articles to rest comfortably on your shelf
until the deadline nears, and then sit down and attempt to read all
these works and hope that your essay will emerge from the vast knowledge
you have gained in reading these books.</p>
<h4 id="outline">Essay Outline</h4>
<p>Anytime between Week 8-11 you should submit an outline of your essay
which includes an overview of how you are thinking of structuring your
essay. This should also include a tentative essay title, the argument
(updated from your prospectus), and hierarchical bullet points that
follow the structure of your essay. You can do this down to the level of
paragraphs, but don’t include whole paragraphs of text in the outline,
just generalized overviews. At the bottom you may include a list of 2-3
questions that you are concerned about or problems you would like advice
on. Then book an office hour and come and discuss your outline with me.
Make sure you have emailed a copy of your outline to Konrad at least a
full 24 hours or more before you meet Konrad in office hours.</p>
<h3 id="how-your-long-essay-is-evaluated">How your Long Essay is
Evaluated</h3>
<p>The points that follow should be fairly clear from the questions
posed above but are restated from the perspective of the marker of a
very strong long essay:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> The essay gives a clear presentation of
its argument in the introduction of the essay</li>
<li>The argument of the essay is not trivial, overly general, or merely
represent a summary of the widely recognized academic consensus on a
given topic</li>
<li>The argument is well signposted, with different sub-arguments of the
essay clearly introduced with clear topical sentences.</li>
<li>The essay shows that extensive reading and research was done in
order to write this essay and the evidence is used effectively in
support of the argument</li>
<li>The essay consistently cites its sources with footnotes and these
footnotes are generally formatted well.</li>
<li>The essay engages with the relevant historiography on this topic
directly and effectively</li>
<li>The essay has a good balance between empirical examples and
presenting evidence on the one hand, and strong analysis contributing to
the argument on the other</li>
<li>Unless it is a historiographical essay, the essay works with primary
sources which make a substantive contribution to its main argument.</li>
<li>The essay is written well and has a clear structure.</li>
<li>The essay is within the word limit and of a sufficient length for
its proposed scope.</li>
<li>The School of History Style Guide was carefully followed.</li>
<li>A well-formatted bibliography is provided showing that research was
carried out using sources of an appropriate quality and number.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>Feedback is generally provided directly on the mark sheet, which will
be posted to the MMS within two weeks. Presentation feedback is provided
at two points in the semester so they may be marked in groups. Some
formative feedback on Moodle posts (before they are submitted to MMS)
will be made sporadically throughout the semester, especially on the
first or second post made by a student.</p>
<h1 id="policies">Policies</h1>
<p><strong>Marking</strong></p>
<p>Within the School of History all work is assessed on a scale of 1-20
with intervals of 0.5. Module outcomes are reported using the same scale
but with intervals of 0.1. The assessment criteria set out below are not
comprehensive, but are intended to provide guidance in interpreting
grades and improving the quality of assessed work. Students should bear
in mind that presentation is an important element of assessment and that
failure to adhere to the guidelines set out in the School of History
Style Sheet will be penalised.</p>
<p>The marking scale can be found here:</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/students/ug/assessment/">https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/students/ug/assessment/</a></p>
<p><strong>Extensions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prior</strong> permissions for late submission of work
(“Extensions”) to make fair allowance for adverse circumstances
affecting a student’s ability to submit the work on time will be
considered on a case by case basis. Normally such permissions will only
be granted for circumstances that are both unforeseen and beyond the
student’s control.</p>
<p><strong>Word Limits and Late Work</strong></p>
<p>It is important to work consistently through the semester and work
around your other commitments and deadlines. Plan ahead and don’t save
your work until the last minute. Assessed work with word limits should
be always submitted within those limits. Writing in a clear and concise
manner, and being able to structure and execute an argument that may be
shorter than you feel is required is a skill that is of great use in
academic fields as well as the workplace beyond. Please do not go over
the limit and force yourself to work within them as a practice that will
be important for writing assignments in your future careers.</p>
<p>The official School of Histories penalties for late work and
short/long work are followed in this module:</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/students/ug/assessment/">https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/students/ug/assessment/</a></p>
<p><strong>Please Note</strong>: In this module you will not be
penalised for a <em>long essay</em> that goes over the requested word
range but is up to 5,000 words. This exception applies
<strong>only</strong> to the long essay.</p>
<p><strong>Absence from Classes</strong></p>
<p>Please see this page for more on our attendance policy:</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/students/ug/attendance/">https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/students/ug/attendance/</a></p>
<p><strong>Emails</strong></p>
<p>If you have a question that requires an answer with significant
detail, please consider asking during office hours, or at the beginning
or end of class. Please try to avoid sending emails that require more
than a very brief answer. If the email requires a substantive answer, I
may ask you to bring the question up again after our next class or in
office hours. I will strive to offer a reply to emails received within
48 hours, whenever possible. Emails are usually not responded to over
the weekend and may not even be read until Monday. In writing emails,
please try to be clear about what you are asking, and keep in mind that
your message is one among many from students of multiple classes and
differing contexts. Please mention which course you are in and what
specific matter you are referring to. As in class, feel free to address
me by first name in emails. Finally, before hitting the send button,
please confirm that the answer to your question is not found in the
handbook, on official school websites, or other handouts provided to the
class.</p>
<p><strong>Laptops in Class</strong></p>
<p>Recent studies are increasingly showing that, for whatever reasons,
the handwriting of notes, and the reading of essays on physical paper as
opposed to computers or other reading devices increases the quality of
notes, significantly boosts recall, and better processing of content in
general.</p>
<p>There are, however, many benefits to using a laptop for notes, and
keeping reading content in digital form, not the least ready access,
easy distribution, ability to re-sort notes, searchability, and for
those who have handwriting as poor as mine: simple readability.</p>
<p>You are welcome to bring a laptop to class and use it for notes and
reading. Please do not to use applications on your laptop not related to
our class, including email applications and social media. Obviously they
will interfere with your own concentration but that is not the primary
concern: using other applications on your laptop is a severe distraction
to anyone sitting next to you.</p>
<p>There will a number of occasions during the seminar when full
undivided attention is required by students. Group work not related to
sources, student presentations, and some other moments will not require
any note-taking or referring to documents on your computer. In those
occasions I may ask students to close laptops or turn over tablets so
they can concentrate on the task at hand.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Misconduct and Plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>Academic integrity is fundamental to the values promoted by the
University. It is important that all students are judged on their
ability, and that no student is allowed unfairly to take an advantage
over others, to affect the security and integrity of the assessment
process, or to diminish the reliability and quality of a St Andrews
degree. For more information on university policies see:</p>
<p><a

<p>I have a separate document where I outline the ways in which LLMs
(generative AI) may be used in the course of your research and writing
in ways that will not constitute academic misconduct. This will be
distributed separately.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about the correct presentation of academic
material, you should approach your tutor. You can also contact CEED,
which provides an extensive range of training on Academic Skills.</p>

<h1 id="reading">Reading</h1>
<p>Weekly average pages of required reading: 200-250</p>
<p>This honours module is by no means an easy one. The fact that the
module is on East Asian history, an area which students may have very
little familiarity with, but not a sub-honours survey module, means that
students should be prepared to take the initiative to read around the
assigned materials and delve into the further reading in order to get a
better understanding of the material.</p>
<p>A work load of fifteen to eighteen hours a week (some weeks you may
need a few more, some weeks less) outside of seminar is expected. Of
this, you should expect your weekly preparation for class in terms of
reading to be 7-12 hours in all weeks except the consolidation week and
pair writing week, together with 5-8 hours of work on your assignments
and research, especially for the long essay. I urge you to spread the
load of your work on assignments across the weeks, to prevent stress
towards the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Your weekly reading will usually consist of 200-250 pages of required
reading. Thus, working on an estimate of 250 pages a week total is a
safe bet, or, at roughly 30 pages an hour (taking some limited notes),
about 8-9 hours, but most likely longer if you take more notes. To this
must be added time for your research and assessments.</p>
<p>It is not wise to do your reading in a single sitting, as your
concentration will fade, so I suggest you split the readings into two or
three, and read them across several days. Give yourself more time for
the primary sources vs the secondary sources relative to their length to
allow you to pay especially close attention to language and detail in
the former. I would recommend that you try to “timebox” the readings,
giving yourself a fixed period of time for any given reading and, if it
looks unlikely that you will have time to read something carefully, skim
it with general notes on the main arguments, events, and issues, as
necessary. This is especially useful in weeks when you need to limit
your reading preparation time in order to work more on your research for
the long essay.</p>

href="https://rl.talis.com/3/sta/lists/ACDDAD47-14D3-F1F6-0333-B8469BD83568.html">online
reading list</a> for the module for your convenience but it is harder to
read, is sometimes missing texts, and does not include specific tasks
that I set for your preparation. Always work from the handbook as you
prepare your readings but you can check for ebook versions etc. with the
digital reading list. Again: this <strong>handbook is the canonical
version</strong> of your preparation guidelines, not the sometimes
incorrect online reading list.</p>

<p>Each week you will be <em>required</em> to do additional reading but
have a choice from a selection. We will try to maximise coverage of
elective reading from week to week but may not get to every category in
class discussion. I would like to ask that we try to have at least one
person per category each week. The elective reading is what you do your
elective reading handouts on.</p>
<p>Choose one of these categories: A (Pure Land) OR B (Nichiren) OR C
(Ch’an/Zen) and read only the material labelled with your category from
each text.</p>

something on one of the elective readings you did for last week or this

<h3 id="preparation-8">Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>All students should have reached the writing point for their essay
at this point to allow for revision of drafts of their work after
identifying any weak areas in the argument and returning to evidence as
needed.</li>
<li>When you have completed a first draft of your long essay, read with
a critical eye: is the argument clearly stated in the introduction. Have
you answered the “so what?” question and established what original
contribution your essay is making rather than merely summarising the
existing state of the field? Do all the pieces of your essay work
together to support the main argument or are there areas that lose focus
or are not relevant? Do you have sub-arguments that need strengthening
with further evidence? Do you need to tweak the argument or rebalance
it?</li>
<li>If you haven’t done your essay outline and come to discuss it with
me, this would be a good week to do so.</li>
