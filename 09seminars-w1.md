# Seminars

**Please Note**: We have an [online reading list](https://rl.talis.com/3/sta/lists/ACDDAD47-14D3-F1F6-0333-B8469BD83568.html) for the module for your convenience but it is harder to read, is sometimes missing texts, and does not include specific tasks that I set for your preparation. Always work from the handbook as you prepare your readings but you can check for ebook versions etc. with the digital reading list. Again: this **handbook is the canonical version** of your preparation guidelines, not the sometimes incorrect online reading list.

## Week 1 - Introduction to Buddhism {#buddhism}

### Preparation

- We will try use only the first 40 minutes for introductions, and overview of the semester. During this time, we’ll get everyone’s name and I’ll explain the main forms of assessment briefly.
- Please come having read or at least skimmed over the handbook sections on assessment. You’ll get the handbook before class.
- We will try use only the first 30 minutes for introductions, and overview of the semester. During this time, we'll get everyone's name and I'll explain the main forms of assessment briefly.
- Sign up for your presentation. One in person presentation, a maximum of two recorded presentations per week. (Teams)
- Consider reviewing the topics for each week and ask yourself what topics strike your interest. That is the first step in formulating a long essay topic, which should be something you work on every single week of the semester.

### Elective Reading

Each week you will be *required* to do additional reading but have a choice from a selection. We will try to maximise coverage of elective reading from week to week but may not get to every category in class discussion. I would like to ask that we try to have at least one person per category each week. The elective reading is what you do your elective reading handouts on.

Choose one of these categories: A (Pure Land) OR B (Nichiren) OR C (Ch’an/Zen) and read only the material labelled with your category from each text.
