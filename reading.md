# Tutorial Preparation

**Reading**

This module, which has no final exam, is designed to provide you flexibility in your learning, while also providing themes that enable us to have rich seminar discussion. It is important that you come to tutorial well prepared as you will be expected to know the materials well. Your preparation for each week will require the usual 15-20 hours of work, and I suggest you **divide the preparation time across three days**:

1) Core readings that all students are required to read, usually around 100 pages (3-5 hours)
2) Additional required 'elective' reading that is selected by the student from several options provided. Choose one category of readings to prepare. (4-7 hours)
3) Further reading in the general area of your long essay, specific research towards the long essay, or work on your blog entries and presentation preparation. (3-8 hours)

**Elective Reading Handout**

Each week, you should post a handout (one page front and back at most; see above under presentation section) relating to the category of *elective readings* you have done to the Moodle each week by the evening before class. *Note:* It is fine if your blog entries are written about the same text or texts that your chosen elective reading and handout are about. These handouts are not formally assessed but submission is required. If you have not submitted handouts throughout the semester you will receive an academic alert for not having submitted required work for the semester.

**Introducing Elective Readings to Your Classmates**

In submitting your handout you are showing your understanding of the main arguments and themes of the elective reading you chose. You may be called upon in class, without warning, to tell the class a bit about the category of elective readings that you read. It is therefore important that you have your notes organised well enough to allow you to clearly and concisely present the main ideas. You may be also asked in class to report on the progress on your long essay research. Please be sure to researve some time each week to work on your long essay and be ready to say what progress you have made on it.
