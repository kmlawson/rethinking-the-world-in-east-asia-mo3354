## Specialities

The emphasis in this module is on exploring the ways various religious and political movements and various intellectuals applied their ideas to the problems of social and political transformation of their societies and, in many cases, the world. There is thus a great deal of breadth to this module, and in covering East Asia as a whole, including Japan, Korea, and China, we cannot pretend to be either comprehensive, nor can we examine the various philosophies and traditions in great detail together as a class.

However, each of you will have the opportunity to obtain a degree of familiarity and depth beyond that which is achieved in our discussions together from week to week. This is accomplished in four ways. First, your long essay will allow you to dive into the works of a particular movement, thinker or thinkers, in much more detail. Secondly, your presentation will allow you to better understand one of the movements or thinkers in order to present about it to your classmates. Thirdly, your critical review will likewise enable you to reflect analytically on scholarship about some aspect of a movement or thinker. 

The fourth way you will able to develop expertise in a specific tradition or area is through your semester long specialities. By the second week, I will ask all students to choose two speciality categories that the readings will be roughly divided into, with considerable overlap in some cases:

*First Speciality*: Korea, China, or Japan
*Second Speciality*: Confucianism, Buddhism, Christianity, Folk & Syncretic, Secular

Here the broad category of "Folk & Syncretic" includes Daoism, Shamanistic practices, Japanese Shinto, and new syncretic religious movements, while secular is used to capture movements that include radical political movements such as anarchism, communism, and other movements not closely associated with a particular religious tradition.

Your chosen specialities will help determine the elective reading you do from week to week, and students may, if they like, choose to write all their assessments within one or both of the specialities. 

It should very quickly become clear that the categories indicated by these specialities are deeply problematic. In 19th and 20th century East Asia, there is very little in terms of political, philosophical, or religious movements that wasn't affected by its broader regional or global context. Moreover, a great deal of the thinkers and movements we will explore simply cannot entirely live within the comfortable bounds of a single category. You will meet religious anarchists, Christian-inspired Confucians, and all manner of ideas that are deeply interconnected with the broader intellectual landscape of their region and the world. Despite this fact, however, grounding a larger proportion of ones reading within what is even a deeply flawed category, will nevertheless increase the chance that you will better grasp the longer historical context and sometimes wide array of concepts and problems that arise repeatedly in particular cases.

## Reading

Preparation for honours modules should take two full days of dedicated preparation per week. A work load of an average of fifteen hours a week (some weeks you may need a few more, some weeks less) outside of seminar is expected. Of this, you should expect your weekly preparation for class in terms of reading to be 7-12 hours on average with and additional 3-8 hours of work on your assignments and research, especially for the long essay. I urge you to spread the load of your work on assignments across the weeks, to prevent stress towards the end of the semester. Your weekly reading will usually consist of 150-250 pages of reading. Even at a very slow reading rate of 20 pages an hour (assuming some distractions, note taking) it should be thus possible to read and take notes on a full 250 pages in under 13 hours, even without any skimming. 

It is not wise to do your reading in a single sitting, as your concentration will fade, so I suggest you split the readings into two or three, and read them across several days. Give yourself more time for the primary sources vs the secondary sources relative to their length to allow you to pay especially close attention to language and detail in the former. I would recommend that you try to "timebox" the readings, giving yourself a fixed period of time for any given reading and, if it looks unlikely that you will have time to read something carefully, skim it with general notes on the main arguments, events, and issues, as necessary.  This is especially useful in weeks when you need to limit your reading preparation time in order to work more on your research for the long essay.

You may find the readings on short loan in the library or in some cases in scanned versions or in digital databases online. You can find our module list through the University Library:

Preparing your weekly readings:

Each week, there will be some readings required for everyone that will anchor our discussion. Beyond this, each student should choose from a selection of elective readings from among those works that match either (or both) of their two specialities, 'topping up' their weekly portion of an average of 200 pages. Every week, students must be prepared to answer questions or briefly present summaries of the arguments and relevant details from their elective readings of the week. This is a required component of the module and failure to come prepared may result in the issuing of an academic alert.
