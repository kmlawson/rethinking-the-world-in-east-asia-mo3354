# Tutorial Preparation

**Reading**

This module, which has no final exam, is designed to provide you flexibility in your learning, while also providing themes that enable us to have rich seminar discussion. It is important that you come to tutorial well prepared as you will be expected to know the materials well. Your preparation for each week will require the usual 15-20 hours of work, and I suggest you **divide the preparation time across three days**:

1) Core readings that all students are required to read, usually around 100 pages (3-5 hours)
2) Additional elective reading which is required but selected by the student from several options provided. Choose one category of readings to prepare. (4-7 hours)
3) Further reading in the general area of your long essay or specific research towards the long essay (3-8 hours)

**Elective Reading Handout**

Each week, by Sunday night - **unless you are signed up for a presentation** you will be expected to email me a copy of a single-sided handout relating to one of the *elective readings* you have done (if there is more than a single chapter or work, you can limit the handout to just one chapter or article from the elective reading). The contents of this handout should be similar to the handouts you provide for presentations (see above -  but limited to a single side in this case). *Note:* It is fine if your blog entries are written about the same text or texts that your chosen elective reading and handout are about.

**Introducing Elective Readings to Your Classmates**

In submitting your handout on Sunday night, you are, in a sense, announcing which of the categories of elective reading you have chosen. You may be called upon in class, without warning, to tell the class a bit about the category of elective readings that you read. This is not a full non-assessed presentation but you should be prepared to present the main ideas of one or more texts that comprise the elective reading category in an articulate manner, on the basis of your notes. It is therefore important that you have your notes organised well enough to allow you to clearly and concisely present the main ideas. You may be also asked in class to report on the progress on your long essay research. Please be sure to researve some time each week to work on your long essay and
