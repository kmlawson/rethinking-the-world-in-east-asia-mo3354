# Assignments

The assessed portion of the coursework for this module consists of one long essay, two presentations, a prospectus with an annotated bibliography, and four blog entries. In addition, students are required to come prepared each week having completed the assigned reading and ready to discuss them, and supply a handout for one of their elective readings.

**Note:** Paper submissions are not requested for any of the assessments. You may upload the submissions directly onto MMS. Your handout for presentations should also be uploaded to the presentation section of MMS by the beginning of class on the day of the presentation, but hard copies of this for the class should be brought for distribution to everyone.

### Headers and Formatting

At the top of all your written work or on a cover page, please include:

* The date of submission
* The assignment you are submitting (e.g. Short Essay 1, Long Essay, etc.)
* Your student number
* A specific title describing the contents (for Prospectus write prospectus but also proposed essay title)
* The total number of words (use the word count feature of your word processor)

When formatting your assignments, please follow these guidelines:

* Add page numbers
* Use a minimum of 12 sized font
* Use a serif font (such as Times Roman, Georgia, Garamond), not a sans serif font (such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana)
* Please double space your essays

Other aspects of formatting are highlighted in the School of History style sheet. See the following section.

### Footnotes and References

Please carefully read the St Andrews School of History Style Sheet:

[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/stylesheet.html](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/stylesheet.html)

This document, sections 1-4, contains extremely valuable information on how to compose your essay, including how to format your footnotes and bibliography. In particular, please follow the instructions for footnotes carefully. See below for more on the simpler citation method for use in the critical review essay and in the final examination.

## Prospectus and Annotated Bibliography

The prospectus (500-800 words) and annotated bibliography (no set word count) are worth 10% of your overall grade. It is designed to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your research in progress. It does not need to represent the final choice of topic, but please get your tutor's approval on any major shifts in your essay topic after you submit the prospectus.

**Prospectus** A prospectus summarises the argument you plan to make in the coming long essay, or are exploring at the moment for your longer essay, but also says something about the sources you will use and approach you will take. Look to article, dissertation, and book abstracts as the model for this assignment. Write the prospectus as if the long essay is already written and complete and you are merely summarizing what it has accomplished. You can find these abstracts for academic presentations, for example, on the websites of annual conferences such as the AAS (Association of Asian Studies) meeting or countless other conferences. Article abstracts, another possible model, are found at the beginning of articles of many journal articles. This is an excellent opportunity to test some early ideas you have, or give me an indication of where you are going with your thinking. Due to the very short nature of this assignment, state your topic clearly along with a prospective argument for your essay, then write in a bit more detail about in greater depth discussing how you will use certain sources, what new approach you will take or what existing approaches you are hoping to contest. This exercise can be very helpful to you in processing your thinking about the long essay, and giving me an opportunity to offer feedback along the way. Even if you are still at a relatively early stage in your research, write confidently about a topic and argument even if you are not sure if you will actually able to follow through in the final essay or suspect you may have to change topics. Write to a reader of a publication, as if you are proposing a talk at a conference or providing an abstract to accompany an article submission, not to me as your only reader.

Things to include in the prospectus:

- What is your provisional argument?
- What are you contributing to the historiography on this? That is, how are you going beyond synthesising what is already out there?
- What is some of the previous work on this you will engage with? Or key primary sources you will make use of?
- What is the "so what" of your project?

**Annotated Bibliography**

Below your prospectus, add an annotated bibliography of primary and secondary sources (8-20 would be a fair range at this stage) you are considering for use in the long essay. Below each source, primary and secondary sources in separate categories, add at 1-3 sentences describing the source and why you think it will be useful for your long essay.

## Long Essay

The essay for the course is worth 50% of the total coursework and has a limit of 6,000 words including footnotes. The process of composing an essay of this length is made far easier if you make steady progress throughout the semester rather than face potential panic and disappointment nearer the deadline. Narrow down an area of interest, read within this area of interest, isolate a few questions of interest, carry out further reading and analysis, and then proceed to write an essay which makes a convincing historical argument.

Some class time in most weeks will be dedicated to discussing the essay. It is not uncommon for a student to change topics once or twice during the semester, as the feasibility of one topic or another is evaluated and the sources explored. My suggestion is that you answer two questions for yourself very early in your research: 1) Once you have a general topic or area of history you are interested in, think about what kinds of arguments or historical approaches have been applied to this area before that will serve as the starting point for your intervention? 2) What kinds of primary sources will I have realistic access to for use in the essay unless I want to make a purely historiographical essay based exclusively on secondary materials.

### Topics for the Essay

You may write your essay on any topic related to the intellectual history of East Asia or Southeast Asia (not limited to the time period we primarily focus on). This may include history of religion, history of philosophy, history of social and political thought, history of mass movements impacted by the above, or some aspect of the the intersection between any these histories and the social and political history of East Asia. Check with me first, but I will also be generally open to approving topics on any element of the cultural history of the region as well. 

*Journals for Inspiration:* I would suggest browing some of the following journals, and especially note articles that fit the above description:

*The Journal of Asian Studies*  
*Monumenta Nipponica*  
*Asian Philosophy*  
*Philosophy East and West*  
*Positions: East Asia Cultures Critique*  
*Japanese Journal of Religious Studies*  
*Journal of Japanese Studies*  
*The Journal of Korean Studies*  
*Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies*  
*Journal of Modern Chinese History*  
*Korean Studies*  
*Korea Journal*  
*Japanese Studies*  
*Far Eastern Survey*  
*Dao*  
*Monumenta Serica*  
*Late Imperial China*  
*Modern China*  
*Modern Asian Studies*  
*Asian Studies Review*  
*Critical Asian Studies*  
*The China Quarterly*  
*Journal of the History of Ideas*  
*History and Theory*  
*Global Intellectual History*  


### Making an Argument

The academic study of history embraces change in the past as a way to explore solutions to particular problems. The object of an analytical historical research essay is not to tell us simply what happened, but to use what happened in order to make a historical argument about some problem clearly defined. For example, if an essay was written (to take an example from Chinese history) about some aspect of the Boxer Rebellion, it should not consider its task complete when the major facts of the Boxer Rebellion have been retold. That is closer to the genre of the encyclopaedia entry than of academic historical study. It should endeavour to use the Boxer Rebellion as an opportunity to tell us something, to make an argument about something: what does the rebellion reveal about the nature of Western imperialism? The rise of new religious movements in China? The weakness of the late Qing state? The rise of Japan? And so on. The possibilities are many, but in every case, they offer an answer to the question: So what? Why does this history matter? History can and should tell stories, but a research essay embeds a story within an arc of an argument - if it contains narrative elements, it must also always include an analytic element.

The historical argument in your long essays, in particular, should be clearly and unambiguously stated in the span of 1-3 sentences somewhere in the opening third of the essay, preferably in the opening paragraph or two. It should not be obvious, trivial, or a well-known and rarely contested fact. Challenging as false an existing historian's argument that has become considered obvious and rarely contested, however, is one ambitious way to find your way to an interesting and original argument but only if your evidence is sufficient. Alternatively, if you have found evidence that supports the existing arguments of historians in a given area of research in a new set of sources, from a fresh perspective, or in greater depth, or in a comparative light, that also often yields a strong argument. If you have identified a debate in the historiography and wish to take a position on it without simply repeating all of the points made by one of the participants of the debate, that can also yield an essay with a strong argument but you should take care to acknowledge the position and evidence of the other side.

**Presenting your Argument:** There are a number of different ways to write a strong essay and present the argument, but in this module, I would like to strongly encourage you to "front-load" your argument and do so clearly, that is, to present clearly early in the essay what it is you will argue and why it is important. For example, avoid sentences such as "I will explain..." or "I aim to understand..." or "I will explore..." unless such sentences are immediately followed by the explanation, what you ended up understanding, or what the result of your exploration was. Otherwise, there is a danger that your essay will merely provide a summary of some quantity of information you have found, rather than present the results of your analysis of that research in a useful way. In other words, do not use the introduction to make predictions about what you will do, but tell the reader in very clear terms what you **have argued and shown** in the essay. There are many ways to do this in more or less subtle language but there is no harm in a very clear, "In this essay, I will argue that..." followed by a short overview of what kinds of evidence you will use, how your argument fits into a historiographical context (how your argument relates to what other historians have to say about the matter), and why you think it is important.

For example replace:

*In this essay, I will explore the relationship between the alarm clock sleep function and our productivity in modern life.*

with something like:

*I will argue that the alarm clock sleep function is a major hindrance to our productivity without contributing at all to our rest after a night of sleep. I will base this upon the studies of Hansen and Jenson in 1983 and in a series of interviews with wise old people in 2014. This argument is important because, as I will show, evidence shows that the increased availability of time in the morning to eat a healthier breakfast, carry out some light house chores, and do morning exercise, not only allows for greater evening rest after a long day of work, but decreases the tiredness we feel throughout the day.*

**Sticking to your Argument:** All of us come across many interesting stories, anecdotes, and sub-points that we want to share in writing our essays. However, it is important to stay sharply focused on the argument you are going to make in the essay. After you have finished writing your essay, read it through and for each paragraph and sentence ask yourself if it supported your argument, provided essential background to establishing your argument, or else if it does not offer much of a contribution. If it doesn't, cut it ruthlessly from your essay to make room for better material.

Engaging with the historiography: What does this phrase mean? It means directly and explicitly acknowledging what historians have said about your topic and your specific question in existing work. Point out both positive contributions and problematic ones when appropriate. Who has worked on this before, and what specifically have they argued? See your essay as part of a larger conversation (it doesn't necessarily have to be an adversarial one) that includes previous historians.

Some other questions to ask yourself as you write the long essay:

* Does the essay have a clear introduction which articulates the argument I wish to make in the essay? Does it move beyond telling the reader what the essay is "about" and what the essay "will do" to tell the reader very clearly what *has been accomplished* in the essay and *what be specifically shown* in the essay, and not leave this only for the conclusion?
* Does the essay have a clear conclusion which restates the main points and then makes some effort to contextualise the findings in the broader issues of the course?
* Does the essay situate the argument being made in the context of the sources used, and its relevance to the study of our module topic?
* Does the essay show a good understanding of the sources used, and use them effectively in supporting my argument with clear and specific examples to enforce my points?
* Does the essay avoid long quotations from secondary works whenever possible? Do I instead summarise, without plagiarising, and cite the work of secondary work except when the particular wording or language is key to the argument I wish to make?
* Have I cited with footnotes all claims that are not a well-known and general historical fact.
* Have I used a variety of appropriate sources?
* Have I avoided using phrases like "many historians argue" or "much scholarship" or "it is often argued" and offer specific examples and citations?
* Does the essay retain a strong focus on the main argument, and avoid passages which stray significantly from the main points?
* Does the essay avoid being a summary or introduction to a particular topic, event, or person in order to make a clear argument that is falsifiable?
* Have I gone back and considered my major claims from a critical perspective, and answered any major possible weaknesses in my essay?
* Is my argument non-trivial? That is, does it go beyond a well-known historical consensus about a topic?
* Has the long essay engaged with the historiography on the relevant issue effectively throughout?
* Does the essay consider alternative explanations, acknowledge inconvenient facts, and point out sources or historians who may have differing approaches?
* Did I proofread my essay, check the spelling, and reread for sentences that are unclear?
* Did I carefully follow the style guide for the School of History for all my footnotes?
* Did I include a bibliography at the end of my essay and is it formatted according to the School of History style guide?
* Have I avoided using websites and newspaper articles not by academic authors to support my claims when there are good academic historical scholarship (in monograph, journal article, or online published forms)
* Have I taken care that the background for the argument does not take up too much of the entire length of the essay (less than 25%, usually)
* Did I include a word count in the header and followed the other header guidelines?

### Carrying Out Research for Essays

When you have selected a question or topic for your longer essay the first, most obvious place to look for information on the topic is among the various books and articles that are assigned or proposed in this course, especially the further reading of each week. Early on, it is useful to focus on skimming through sources as you find them, noting carefully works of potential interest found in the footnotes or bibliographies of these works to help you broaden and then later focus in your research. As you find works of interest, make note of the authors and look for other articles or books by the same author, then repeat the process, looking again through the footnotes and bibliography for sources more specifically related to the topic you are researching.

When you do not find enough through the above method of beginning your trail with our existing assigned works, proceed to search in various databases for relevant keywords:

* Our library catalogue
* Major journal databases we have access to such as JSTOR
* Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) which can then direct you to other journals our library may provide access to
* Consult with librarians - they are your friend. Bring them what you have found already and work with them to find further resources.
* Learn to use Google more effectively:
    * Search for phrases in quotation marks " " when appropriate
    * Try adding filetype:pdf to limit results to PDF files
    * You can limit searches to a particular domain or top-level domain, e.g. including: site:st-andrews.ac.uk or site:.edu

The long essays should use at least half a dozen sources which are not websites and the inclusion of primary sources is encouraged but not required. An essay based on sources that are the results of a simple google search can be written in an evening of frantic last minute work, but rarely demonstrates much effort, research skill, or ability to isolate high-quality materials to support an argument. This is not because there are not excellent websites with overviews on a topic, excellent wikipedia entries, etc. but because there is still usually far greater quality material found in published articles and books on most historical topics, including those which are assigned above. It is wise to make use of online research skills to get oriented in a new topic, but use this course as an opportunity to explore the wealth of academic research on your topics. Your essays will be assessed, in part, on how effectively your sources demonstrate your research efforts. Of course, digitized primary (archival sources, documents) or secondary sources (e.g. articles in academic databases) found in digital collection are permitted and an online source or two in addition to your other sources beyond the minimum is fine if chosen carefully for quality.

When you have found a good selection of a dozen or two sources through a process of skimming of footnotes and bibliographies etc., start your more detailed reading with something of broader coverage to give you some ideas of potential specific arguments or hypotheses. Then move swiftly and with more focus to search through the other sources in the specific sections that are likely to show whether your potential argument holds or not. In researching for an essay you rarely have to read an entire work, and even when you do so, you should skim less relevant sections. Unlike reading for pleasure, historical research involves reading as a hunt for answers to problems. If you find that your argument does not hold or has insufficient evidence to support it, zoom out again and restart the process.

This circular movement is one very effective approach to historical research. Start broad, find potential key arguments and inspiring ideas. Moving quickly, test these ideas and arguments by searching in other sources and zooming into detailed cases and examples. If this doesn't work or is insufficient, zoom out again and repeat. Once you are happy with an argument and the available evidence, then read more slowly and with determination, taking more detailed notes, and outlining your essay as you go.

**The Worst Possible Way to Proceed:** Perhaps the worst possible way to do research for your essay is to find a dozen or two works on your broad topic by title search. This usually results in you finding several very general and introductory works on your topic. Allow this collection of books and articles to rest comfortably on your shelf until the deadline nears, and then sit down and attempt to read all these works and hope that your essay will emerge from the vast knowledge you have gained in reading these books.

### How your Long Essay is Evaluated

The points that follow should be fairly clear from the questions posed above but are restated from the perspective of the marker of a very strong long essay:

- The essay gives a clear presentation of its argument in the introduction of the essay
- The essay is written well and has a clear structure.
- The essay is within the word limit and of a sufficient length for its proposed scope.
- The argument is well signposted, with different sub-arguments of the essay clearly introduced with clear topical sentences.
- The essay shows that extensive reading and research was done in order to write this essay.
- The School of History Style Guide was carefully followed.
- A well-formatted bibliography is provided showing that research was carried out using sources of an appropriate quality and number.
- The essay consistently cites its sources with footnotes and these footnotes are generally formatted well.
- This essay employs evidence based on its sources in an effective manner.
- Unless it is a historiographical essay, the essay works with primary sources which make a substantive contribution to its main argument.
- The essay engages with the relevant historiography on this topic directly and effectively
- The essay has a good balance between empirical examples and presenting evidence on the one hand, and strong analysis contributing to the argument on the other
- The argument of the essay is not trivial, overly general, or merely represent a summary of the widely recognized academic consensus on a given topic

### Online Submission

Unless otherwise indicated, work will considered submitted by the date the document was submitted online on the MMS. Paper copies do not need to be submitted: let's save paper. If you are concerned that any given assignment was not correctly submitted to the MMS, you are free to email a copy of your submitted assignment, if you like. In the event an assignment was not correctly uploaded to the MMS for some reason, but an emailed copy was sent in time, that date of submission will be used, but a copy will still need to be submitted to the MMS thereafter.

### Feedback

Feedback is generally provided directly on the mark sheet, which will be posted to the MMS within 10 work days (2 weeks). Presentation feedback is provided towards the end of the semester. Some assessments may have additional handwritten feedback provided in the margins.

## Oral Presentations

Being able to synthesise reading and present ideas orallly in class is a key skill. You will receive a mark on **two presentations**, but *may optionally offer up to three (if module ≥ 8 students) or four (if module < 8 students) presentations during the semester*. If you present three times instead of two, *your two best presentation marks will be posted* after our last meeting.

Presentation skill is shown in your ability to: choose what is most useful to share, choose a quantity of information that will still allow you to speak at a measured pace, project your voice clearly, make use of effective pauses, modulate your voice effectively, make use of a spoken rather than a written register that engages the listener, give eye contact to everyone in the room, avoid exactly reproducing the content of a handout, and present in a way that, even if you are referring to a written set of notes or text, still flows naturally.

The assessed presentations should be 5-7 minutes in length and not a minute longer. You will be cut off at exactly 7 minutes. The presentation should briefly summarise the main arguments, point out what was most interesting or useful as a takeaway from the chosen text, and make 1-3 focused critiques or observations about the read material. It is *not* a detailed summary of the content: it should highlight the arguments, strengths and set the context.

A supplementary handout (one piece of paper front and back at most) should be emailed to me by Sunday night and sufficient copies brought to class. It should include some paragraphs or bullet points that may include arguments, interesting empirical examples, key quotes, any interesting sources used, or highlight key persons or dates. The bullet points should be complete sentences (describing an argument or concrete point), not merely short phrases representing vague topics in an outline form. Please bring copies of the handout to class but also add (or link) the handout text to the class collaborative notes document. When possible, excellent presentations will ideally connect what is read and presented to our other readings and the discussion of the day. Thus, it is very important that you do not focus on your assigned reading to the exclusion of other readings for that week. Connecting the reading to past readings and discussions in the module is also a very welcome. Outside research is not required. Slides are not needed for the presentation and not assessed, but the handout may include 1-2 images or a map if appropriate. Please note, when discussion questions have been provided in advance on a topic, the presentation need not provide any answer to these, though the presentation may raise points that are a relevant contribution to those questions.

Some questions to consider as you prepare:

* Did the student give eye contact to everyone in the room and not merely the tutor?
* Did the student project their voice clearly, modulate their voice appropriately, make effective use of pauses, and speak at an appropriate speed?
* Did the distributed handout of one or at most two sides of a piece of paper accurately summarize the general points to be made in the presentation in the form of concise bullet points
* Did the handout include any important dates, sources, or a map that serves as a useful reference?
* Was the 7 minute limit very strictly observed in the presentation?
* Did the presentation briefly provide the context of the work, and introduce the author *very briefly*?
* Was the presentation well-structured, organized, and focus on a only a few key points?
* Was there a good balance of arguments, examples to support them, and critique?
* Did the presentation avoid being a presentation of a series of bullet-point style facts?
* Did the presentation avoide being a reproduction of the handout, using it instead as a complement.
* Did the presentation make an effort to connect the readings to other readings for the day or find ways to connect to the reading and discussion from previous weeks?

## Blog Entries

We have a module website at:

[http://transnationalhistory.net/world/](http://transnationalhistory.net/world/)

This is a public facing website where students will contribute postings, but no students will be asked to use their real name. You can set or change your pseudonym through the blog interface whenever you like. Students are required to post a minimum of four postings, and these postings must be spread across at least four different weeks. The total number of words must be a minimum of 3,000 words posted during the course of the semester (for example, four postings with 750 words, or six postings with 500, etc.). You are also asked, *each week*, to post a comment on at least one posting (by another student), though this is not assessed.

At the end of the semester, you should copy and paste four selected blog postings (Note: they may total less than 3,000 overall since you could have posted more than four during the semester), including their titles, links to the online version, and the date they were posted online into a document and upload this to MMS. The postings must already be on the blog, and cannot be new postings produced for the submission. Points for the overall mark will be the average of the mark on the four selected and submitted postings. Each posting will receive a mark based on the cumulative score according to the following simple criteria, which are judged to be *either present or absent* (no partial marks)

* 5 points if the posting makes a clear analytical point
* 4 points if the posting makes concrete references to particular parts of a reading, with a footnote
* 3 points if the posting was well-written in terms of language
* 3 points if the posting was relevant to assigned readings or further readings
* 3 points if the posting keeps a good focus throughout.
* 2 additional points will be given for postings that are of a high quality

A decent posting, with no significant flaws, should, therefore, get a score of 18. Particularly strong postings may garner 20s. *Example:* A student writes 6 postings during the semester totaling 3,200 words. They select four of these, including 1 high quality post of 500 words (20), 2 posts that meet the requirements, one 400 and one 600 words (each getting 18), and 1 post of 800 words that follows all the above but did not maintain a clear focus (18-3=15), then the overall blog mark would come to (20+18+18+15)/4 = 17.8

**How to Post Blog Entries:** You will be given details for your login information late in the first week. Then to login, go to:

[http://transnationalhistory.net/world/post/](http://transnationalhistory.net/world/post/)

- Use your login user name and password.
- From there, on the left hand sidey ou can choose "Add New" from the "Posts" menu.
- There, give your posting a title
- add a few tags on the right side without any caps, for example "japan, 20th century, kyoto school, philosophy of time, nishitani" that indicate things like place, time, people, topics that are relevant to your posting (all without caps).
- Write your blog posting in the middle
- When you have a quote or refer to a text, you must add a footnote by enclosing the footnote countents in double parenthesis. You must leave a space before the first and after the last parenthesis. Example: Here is some text. ((And here is the footnote contents with a space before it))
- Don't worry about adding categories.
- You can "preview" your posting if you want to read it over and look for mistakes with a nicer view.
- When you are happy with the posting, click "Publish" or save the draft if you wish to return to it later
- You can always return to postings by going to "Posts" on the left and "All Posts"

**What to Write:**

- Your postings should ideally each aim to be between 400-1,000 words but you won't be penalised for something longer on word count alone.
- The posts should have a single overarching purpose and unified focus
- The posts should be primarily focused on material in the elective or further readings, and may only be from the required set readings if it is a primary source. It may refer to additional readings from anywhere.
- Avoid vague references to what you like and don't like; what you found interesting or not interesting - unless you follow this up with concrete and specific reasons why something is interesting or valuable.
- Be concise and avoid repetition. 

Here are some ideas of what make good postings (but you aren't limited to this):

- Focus in on a passage in a primary source, quote part of the passage (try not to make the quote too long) in the posting and then offer a reflection on it.
- Same as above, but instead of just offering a reflection, put that passage into meaningful conversation with another secondary or primary reading we did either this week or another week.
- Describe or synthesise a point that you find important or interesting from a secondary reading and say why you think it is important.
- Put the arguments of two secondary sources into dialogue with each other
- Reflect on how the arguments of a text might contribute to our understanding of some other clase in another place or time
- Write a posting on the use of language or terms in a source and why you think it is meaningful or important
- Write a posting around a certain pattern you see across multiple texts
