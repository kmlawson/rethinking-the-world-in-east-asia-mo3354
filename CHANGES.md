# Changes

Here I list some of the significant changes in this module over the years, after the module was first offered spring of 2014.

## 2019 Spring

First run of the module. We are still missing a lot of books from the library despite extra funds for orders. Hoping to fill out some of our missing elective and further readings that I will have to provide partial scans of in future years.
