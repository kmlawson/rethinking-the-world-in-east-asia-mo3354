# Changes

Here I list some of the significant changes in this module over the years, after the module was first offered spring of 2014.

## 2021 Fall

- Changed the blog assignment to allow for feedback earlier in the semester
- W7 added imperial way reading to elective, reduced required reading by creating new elective
- W8 added new elective reading category
- W1 some reduction in reading
- W2 number reading changes and reduction to required reading; adjustments to OgyÅ« reading
- Various page number/reading fixes across readings


## 2019 Spring

First run of the module. We are still missing a lot of books from the library despite extra funds for orders. Hoping to fill out some of our missing elective and further readings that I will have to provide partial scans of in future years.

## 2019 Fall

* Second run of the module but limited time for updates. Made some additions to elective readings here and there. Especially grateful to Erik Schicketanz for his suggestions for the reading list. 
* Clarified some of the assessments
